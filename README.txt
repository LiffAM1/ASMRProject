Welcome! 

This is the code for a mini project I am doing for an ASMR video series on my YouTube
channel (WorstLolNA). The following concepts will be covered throughout the series:
- IronPython
- NHibernate
- WebAPI self hosting
- Selenium webscraping (possibly)
- Some light SQL Server stuff :)

Go ahead and clone if you would like to follow along with the videos!
